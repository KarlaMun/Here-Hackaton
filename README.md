# Here-Hackaton
MAP ANOMALY DETECTION
## Objective
Automate the relocation and validation of POI's, provided by HERE Technologies. 
## Description
This project performs an initial exploration and cleaning of geospatial data of streets and points of interest, combining information from different files, verifying the quality of the data (missing values, matching geometries, repeated names) and visualizing the results to better understand the structure and distribution of spatial information in Mexico City. 
## Results
We can verify if the point of interest is in the indicated place or not, generating a graph that shows the links between the CORRECTED POIs and their altitude and latitude.
